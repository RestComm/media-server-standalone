[[_ctms_configuring_the_media_server_manual]]
== Manual Configuration

The RestComm Media Server features an extensible configuration file, allowing users to have some control over several aspects of its behavior.

Users can configure the Media Server by editing the file located at _$MS_HOME/conf/mediaserver.xml_. The XML file is divided into several main nodes, each one representing a specific aspect of the Media Server:

* *Network* refers to the network configuration. Depends on network topology of the machine where Media Server is installed.
* *Media* refers to the media processing and RTP configuration.
* *Controller* refers to the Media Server Controller configuration. Defines which control protocol is used so that Media Server can communicate with Call Agents.
* *Resources* refers to the resource pooling configuration. Depends on expected load on the server.
* *DTLS* refers to configuration of security layer for media.

=== Network Configuration

.Network configuration
====
[source,xml]
----
<network>
	<bindAddress>127.0.0.1</bindAddress>
	<externalAddress>127.0.0.1</externalAddress>
	<network>127.0.0.1</network>
	<subnet>255.255.255.255</subnet>
	<sbc>false</sbc>
</network>
----
====

==== Address Bindings

*BindAddress* is the address of the network interface to which Media Server is bound to. All RTP channels are open on this address.

*ExternalAddress* is the public address of the server. It is mainly used to patch SDP and to expose SRFLX candidates during ICE negotiation.

==== Network, Subnet and SBC

The Media server can work in two distinct modes: Standard or SBC.

When *sbc* is set to false, the Media Server will establish a channel based on address/port pair it receives from SDP response.
However, if the RTP packet is used within a NAT context, data sent in SDP is the original data and not the NATted IP address/port (this is often the scenario).
Furthermore, when *sbc* is set to false, data will be sent to invalid address and also will not be accepted since Media Server does not know the correct address of the UA.
 
In order to solve NAT issues the *sbc* option must be set to true.
As result, Media Server will wait for first RTP packet; learn its remote IP address and port and only then it will send data based on the remote address and not on SDP response.

As consequence inter-server traffic will not work since both sides will be waiting for first packet.
To solve this, you should set local network and local subnet to a range that will include all Media Servers in the same cluster.
If the Media Server detects that the IP address and port in SDP are within the local IP network range, it will start sending packets immediately and not wait.
This is similar to when *sbc* is set to false.


=== Controller Configuration

This configuration subset defines the default Media Server Controller, the core component that processes incoming requests and manages media resources.


The default controller is based on MGCP protocol. Enabling MGCP is always required as the JSR-309 driver is based on the current MGCP implementation as well.


.Controller Configuration
====
[source,xml]
----
<controller protocol="mgcp">
	<address>127.0.0.1</address>
	<port>2427</port>
	<channelBuffer>5000</channelBuffer>
	<endpoints>
		<endpoint name="mobicents/bridge/" class="org.mobicents.media.server.mgcp.endpoint.BridgeEndpoint" poolSize="50" />
		<endpoint name="mobicents/ivr/" class="org.mobicents.media.server.mgcp.endpoint.IvrEndpoint" poolSize="50" />
		<endpoint name="mobicents/cnf/" class="org.mobicents.media.server.mgcp.endpoint.ConferenceEndpoint" poolSize="50" />
	</endpoints>
	<configuration>mgcp-conf.xml</configuration>
	<poolSize>25</poolSize>
</controller>
----
====

==== Network

The *Address* parameter defines the address of the network interface to which the controller is bound to. The control channel is open on this address.

The *Port* parameter defines the port where the control channel will listen to for incoming requests. By default, it is set to 2427.

The *PoolSize* parameter defines the number of MGCP requests that Media Server can handle concurrently.

The *channelBuffer* parameter defines the MGCP channel buffer size which limits the size of incoming MGCP messages that are received by the MGCP channel. By default it is set to 5000.

==== Endpoints

The *Endpoints* configuration allows you to configure all MGCP endpoint groups you want to use with the Media Server instance.

The *Configuration* parameter points to an XML file containing the definitions of MGCP packages, signals and packages mapping to endpoints.

The user can configure the initial *poolSize* for each endpoint type.
This value will determine the number of endpoints that are preloaded on startup.

.Endpoint Pooling
[NOTE]
====
If all available endpoints are used and a request for  additional endpoint is received, Media Server will allocate a new endpoint and store it in a resource pool.

The only exception to this rule is DS0 endpoint type.
The DS0 endpoint can not be increased as it is directly related to the number of channels available on an E1/T1 card.
====

The *Name* parameter represents the name pattern to be used for MGCP requests that target a specific endpoint type.
For example, the name pattern _mobicents/aap_ will be created and accessed as _mobicents/aap/$_ (where $ is an integer representing the endpoint ID).  

The *Class* parameter represents the class of installer.
Currently 2 types of installers are available:

* [path]*VirtualEndpointInstaller* which allows you to install most endpoints
* [path]*VirtualSS7EndpointInstaller* which is used for DS0 endpoints. 

Endpoint class â€“ defines the class which implements endpoints. 

Currently, the following endpoint classes are available : 

.Endpoint Classes
[cols="1,1,1,1", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| Endpoint Class | Available Resources | Connection Types | Relay Type
| org.mobicents.media.server.mgcp.endpoint.AnnouncementEndpoint | Player | Local+RTP | Mixer
| org.mobicents.media.server.mgcp.endpoint.IvrEndpoint | Player,Recorder,Dtmf Detector,Dtmf Generator | Local+RTP | Mixer
| org.mobicents.media.server.mgcp.endpoint.ConferenceEndpoint | None | Local+RTP | Mixer
| org.mobicents.media.server.mgcp.endpoint.BridgeEndpoint | None | Local+RTP | Splitter
| org.mobicents.media.server.mgcp.endpoint.PacketRelayEndpoint | None | RTP | Mixer
| org.mobicents.media.server.mgcp.endpoint.Ds0Endpoint | Signal Detector,Signal Generator | Local+RTP | Splitter
|===

A Mixer endpoint will mix together data from both connections and resources.
This implies that it will still be available even without the appropriate setting mode. 

A Splitter endpoint is not a standard MGCP endpoint type, as it handles two different resources groups.
The first group uses local connections whereas the second group uses RTP connections.
This implies that non-RTP connections can communicate with RTP endpoints and none local connections can still access local endpoints.

The Bridge endpoint, a Splitter type, is useful in the scenarios shown below: 

image::images/bridge-endpoint-ivr-conference.png[]

In this scenario, both IVR and Conference endpoints will be connected by a pair of Local Connections to the Bridge Endpoint. This is considered a good practice as there will be no cross over of IVR Resources (player , recorder , etc) to conference.
The same applies to any conference traffic, it will not cross over to IVR.
This is useful for recording RTP data for specific groups of users. 

DS0 endpoint is a type Splitter.
All connections, signal detector and signal generator are in group 1,  while signalling channel SS7 is placed in group 2.
That means that any SS7 channel data will be sent to any connection and signal detector, while data from signal generator and any connection will be sent only to SS7 channel. 

.Endpoint Groups
[NOTE]
====
In order to configure multiple groups of endpoints of the same type per Media Server instance, you must change the name of each group. 
====

=== Media Configuration

The media configuration contains definitions that have an impact on the media channels.

.Media Configuration
====
[source,xml]
----
<media>
	<timeout>30</timeout>
	<maxDuration>14400</maxDuration>
	<lowPort>34534</lowPort>
	<highPort>65534</highPort>
	<jitterBuffer size="50" />
	<codecs>
		<codec name="l16" />
		<codec name="pcmu" />
		<codec name="pcma" />
		<codec name="gsm" />
		<codec name="opus" />
		<codec name="g729" />
	</codecs>
</media>
----
====

==== RTP Channels

The *LowPort* and *HighPort* define the port range reserved for RTP channels.
These values should be an even number, since odd ports are reserved for RTCP channels.

The *MaxDuration* value defines the maximum duration an RTP channel can remain open, thus limiting the lifetime of calls. If set to zero, the connection will stay open forever.

The *JitterBuffer* size parameter sets the maximum capacity of the jitter buffer, in milliseconds.
Jitter Buffers are commonly configured to hold up to 50-60ms of audio.

==== RTP Timeout

Most SIP UA do not support any type of keep-alive between 200 OK and BYE.
Therefore, in case the network goes down while a call is established, the call may hang forever.
That is why RTP streaming should not be interrupted (exception to rule being _recvonly_ and _inactive_ modes). With the this in mind, the Media Server features the *timeout* parameter. 

When *timeout* is set to greater than 0, the Media Server will monitor RTP traffic and if it finds period equal or greater then the RTP timeout (in seconds) it will delete the connection and notify the server that a connection was removed (by sending DLCX MGCP command). Consequently, any border server will receive a reliable notification that the call is still alive even when the communication network is no longer available. 

NOTE: When enabling RTP timeout, it is recommended that you do not set the mode to _inactive_ or _sendonly_ when you expect to receive data (after 180 or 200 OK) depending on your application 

.Call Flow
====
[source,xml]
----

Similar call flow may be like this

UA ----> INVITE ----> Control Server
Control Server ----> CRCX with mode inactive ----> Media Server
Control Server ----> INVITE ----> inside network or to other side
Inside network or other side ----> 183 with SDP ----> Control Server
Control Server ---> MDCX with mode sendonly ---> Media Server
Control Server ---> 183 with SDP ----> UA
Inside network or other side ----> 200 ----> Control Server
Control Server ---> MDCX with mode sendrecv ---> Media Server
Control Server ---> 200 ----> UA
----
====

In case of 180 or 183 without SDP response , intermediate MDCX is not required. 


==== Codecs

Currently media server supports six codecs : G711 A/U, Linear PCM Raw, GSM, ILBC, Opus and G.729.

.G.729 usage
WARNING: Please note that a valid license is required to use G.729 , therefore you should purchase a license prior to enabling this codec. 

If you decide to use a single codec for encoding or decoding data, you should leave one RAW or 2 Raw pair.
This is useful only in case of a one way activity. 

.L16 usage
NOTE: L16 codec is useful only in server to server communication where you have enough network bandwidth.
It is not recommended to allow L16 codec for UA â€“ server connections, this can lead to degradation of the signal quality due to increased jitter and packet loss.

.Opus usage
NOTE: Opus codec processes data internally at 8kHz as mono signal. This sample rate and number of channels are limiting factors for sound quality when this codec is used. Bitrate is around 20 kbps. Payload type is fixed to value 111. It won't work with clients with other payload type values assigned to Opus codec. 

==== Opus Codec Configuration

http://opus-codec.org/[Opus Codec] is open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec.

Prerequisite library for Opus codec is `libopus` (or `libopus-dev` if the project is compiled from sources).

[source,shell]
----
# CentOS/RHEL
yum install libopus

# Ubuntu/Debian
apt-get install libopus

# macOS
brew install opus
----

The location of libopus library and name of compiled JNI library used by media server are specified by command line parameters. The values of the parameters are defined in file `bin/run.sh`.


=== Resources Configuration

In the current Media Server release, a global pool of resources is used to decrease garbage collection and allow for faster resource allocation.

.Resources Configuration
====
[source,xml]
----
<resources>
	<localConnection poolSize="100" />
	<remoteConnection poolSize="50" />
	<player poolSize="50" />
	<recorder poolSize="50" />
	<dtmfDetector poolSize="50" dbi="-35" />
	<dtmfGenerator poolSize="50" toneVolume="-20" toneDuration="80" />
	<signalDetector poolSize="0" />
	<signalGenerator poolSize="0" />
</resources>
----
====

As seen above, default pool sizes are configured for each possible type of media components:

* *Local Connection* - Link between two MGCP Endpoints;
* *Remote Connection* - Link between an MGCP Endpoint and a remote peer;
* *Player* - Plays audio tracks;
* *Recorder* - Records audio streams;
* *DTMF Generator* - Generates out-of-band DTMF tones;
* *DTMF Detector* - Detects both inband and out-of-band tones;
* *Signal Detector* - Detects SS7 tones;
* *Signal Generator* - Generates SS7 tones.


.About DTMF Detector Dbi
[NOTE]
====
Audio data is mixed with DTMF inband tones often.
As result, Media Server may detect false positive tones, or it may not detect tones which are sent.

By setting DTMF detector dbi parameter, the user can optimize tone detection by fine-tuning this parameter. However, default value has been tested and found to be generally appropriate.

Good practice mandates that inband tones should be used only in SS7/IP mixed network.
IP-only networks should use out-of-band tones only and disable inband detection. 
====

Signal Detector and Signal Generator are currently only used for connectivity tests for DS0 channel (COT isup signal), CO1, CO2, CT (Continuity Transport) and Loopback test modes.

For more information please see http://localhost:50253/afx/resource/Users/hrosa/Telestax/mobicents/mediaserver/git/mediaserver/docs/sources-asciidoc/src/main/asciidoc/preview.html#_msep_ms_event_packages[[_msep_ms_event_packages]]

.When the specified resource type is not available
[NOTE]
====
Please note that a resource will be automatically allocated if the specified resource type is not available in the resource pool.
This will require more memory allocation and in some cases may impact performance.

The more resources you have pre-configured on startup in the resource pool, the more memory the Media Server will require on startup.
It is up to the user to decide the best trade-off for the setup (greater memory usage on startup vs slower response when new resources are required in runtime).
====

=== DTLS Configuration

The DTLS configuration allows to define some properties that are used by WebRTC resources, through the DTLS protocol. Since the nature of this configuration is strongly related with security principles, *some of the default values of this configuration need to be replaced by the user's private information, ensuring that no vulnerabilities could be exploited by someone else.* This refers mainly to the *certificate*, that is shipped with mediaserver for demonstration purposes only, and its better explained in the *Certificate* subsection.

==== DTLS Version

The properties *minVersion* and *maxVersion* define the supported minimum and maximum version of the DTLS protocol, respectively. The possible values suported by each property is *1.0* or *1.2*. 

==== Cipher suites

The *cipherSuites* property allows to inform one or more cipher suites to be used by DTLS. The names of the suites follows the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#ciphersuites[JSSE cipher suite naming standard] and must be separated by comma.
The following examples show how to set the cipher suites can be configured using *RSA* and *ECDSA*.

==== Certificate

This property allows to set the absolute or relative path of the certificate and key files. The path for the certificate file must be informed in the *path* property, and the path for the key file must be informed in the *key* property. The signature algorithm used for the certificates must be informed at the *algorithm* property, which supports the values *rsa* and *ecdsa*. The default certificate files must be replaced by certificates generated by the user, as described by the following warning:

IMPORTANT: The default certificate files that comes with mediaserver are for test purposes only. The use of the default certificates in production environment represent a potential vulnerability. *The default certificate files must be replaced by certificates generated by the user.*

The certificate files *x509-server.pem* and *x509-server-key.pem* correspond to the default *RSA* certificates, while the files *x509-server-ecdsa.pem* and *x509-server-key-ecdsa.pem* correspond to the default *ECDSA* certificates. Those files can be found at the directory *$MS_HOME/conf/dtls* of a mediaserver installation.
The following examples show how to properly set up mediaserver according to the chosen signature algorithm (*RSA* or *ECDSA*). Note that the *cipher suites*, *certificates* and *algorithm* change from one configuration to another.

=== Configure Speech Recognition Drivers

Media Server supports Automatic Speech Recognition functionality albeit depending on third party service providers such as Google Speech or IBM Watson.

It features a *pluggable* architecture, allowing users to choose their favourite provider. To do so, the user only needs to provide and register a driver in the configuration file.
To install a new driver users simply need to copy the driverâ€™s jar file to the `MS_HOME/lib` directory and declare it in the configuration file.

The `mediaserver.xml` configuration file contains a specific section to define list of supported drivers grouped by subsystem:

.Configuration for drivers subsystem
====
[source,xml]
----
<subsystems>
        <subsystem name="asr">
            ...
        </subsystem>
</subsystems>
----
====

Each driver must declare the attributes `name` and `class`. Furthermore, each driver can require a custom list of parameters. Each parameter is composed by a pair of `name` and `value` attributes.
Example:

.Example configuration for drivers subsystem
====
[source,xml]
----
<subsystems>
         <subsystem name="asr">
                <driver name="some-driver" class="org.restcomm.media.drivers.asr.provider.ProviderAsrDriver">
                        <parameter name="param1">value1</parameter>
                        <parameter name="param2">value2</parameter>
                </driver>
        </subsystem>
</subsystems>
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Sometimes a driver will require system-wide configuration, such as environment variables to be defined.

Itâ€™s responsibility of the user to consult with ASR Service Provider about configuration requirements for a given driver.

=== Configuring the logger

The Media Server Logger features two static *Appenders*, one that outputs to the Terminal console and the other for the log file located at `MS_HOME/log/server.log`. The user can define the minimum logging threshold for each appender, which will filter logging statements.

If the user which to have more control over the logging threshold for a specific component of the Media Server, he can do so by defining logging *Categories*.
A logging Category follows the format `<package_name>:<log_threshold>`, where _package_name_ refers to the Media Server package to which the Logger will impose the _log_threshold_.

In the following example, the Logger will output RTP-related traces with DEBUG level or higher.

[NOTE]
====
Note that even though DEBUG traces are enabled for RTP stack, the Console and File appenders still impose a root threshold of INFO for any other traces.
====

.Configuration for Logger
====
[source,shell]
----
# Valid logging thresholds: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
# Root Threshold
LOG_ROOT=INFO

LOG_FILE_URL=log/server.log

# Categories
LOG_CATEGORY_RTP='org.restcomm.media.rtp:DEBUG'
----
====

If the user wished to, for example, define a logging threshold for the MGCP stack, he could do by adding a new Category as shown below:

[source,shell]
----
LOG_CATEGORY_MGCP='org.restcomm.media.control.mgcp:DEBUG'
----

The user can also edit the *LOG_FILE_URL* parameter to define the location of the Media Server's log file.

[NOTE]
====
*LOG_FILE_URL* can be set to use either relative or absolute URL. If relative URL is used, then the root address of the URL will be the root directory of the Media Server installation (commonly known as _MS_HOME_).

[[_ctms_configuring_the_media_server_automatic_ssl]]
=== Configuring Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

**SSL** is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral.

To configure SSL, the user must edit the _ssl.conf_ file. The changes will take effect during bootstrap.

.Configuration for SSL
====
[source,shell]
----
# Secure SSL configuration.
SSL_ENABLED=false
SSL_KEYSTORE=conf/ssl/keystore.jks
SSL_PASSWORD=changeme
----
====

The parameter *SSL_ENABLED* can assume the values `true` or `false` and dictates whether SSL is enabled or not.
If SSL is enabled, then the user must assign the path of the KeyStore to the variable *SSL_KEYSTORE* as well as its password in *SSL_PASSWORD*.

[NOTE]
====
*SSL_KEYSTORE* can be set to use either relative or absolute URL. If relative URL is used, then the root address of the URL will be the root directory of the Media Server installation (commonly known as _MS_HOME_).
====

Support for SSL is enabled by appending a new set of parameters to the JAVA_OPTS of the Media Server process. These definitions are present in the script `MS_HOME/bin/run.sh`.

.SSL configuration in JAVA_OPTS
====
[source,shell]
----
# SSL Configuration
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=../conf/ssl/mediaserver.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeme"

=== Running

To use the automatic configuration and bootstrapping mechanism, users simply need to edit _mediaserver.conf_ file according to their environment and then execute the _start-mediaserver.sh_ script.

[source,shell]
----
bash-3.2# ./start-mediaserver.sh

Media Server automatic configuration finished!
Starting RestComm Media Server...
...RestComm Media Server started running on session named "mediaserver"!
----

From the Terminal output, we see the script configuring the Media Server according to the values of _mediaserver.conf_. Then, is created a tmux session named _mediaserver_ where the Media Server process will be running.

[source,shell]
----
bash-3.2# tmux ls
mediaserver: 1 windows (created Wed Nov  2 22:05:14 2016) [160x35]
----

To access the _mediaserver_ session we just need to run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
bash-3.2# tmux attach -t mediaserver
----

To detach from tmux session, just press `ctrl+b d` from within tmux console.

[[_ctms_configuring_the_media_server_automatic_stopping]]
=== Stopping

To stop the Media Server process and kill the tmux session, the user simply needs to execute the stop-mediaserver.sh script.

[source,shell]
----
bash-3.2# ./stop-mediaserver.sh 
Stopping RestComm Media Server...
...stopped RestComm Media Server instance running on session "mediaserver".
bash-3.2# tmux ls
