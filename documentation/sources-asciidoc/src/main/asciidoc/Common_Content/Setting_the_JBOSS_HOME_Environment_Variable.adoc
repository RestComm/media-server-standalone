= Setting the JBOSS_HOME Environment Variable

The [app]` Platform` ([app]``) is built on top of the [app]``.
You do not need to set the [var]`JBOSS_HOME` environment variable to run any of the [app]` Platform` servers _unless_ [var]`JBOSS_HOME` is _already_ set. 

The best way to know for sure whether [var]`JBOSS_HOME` was set previously or not is to perform a simple check which may save you time and frustration.

.Checking to See If JBOSS_HOME is Set on Unix
At the command line, `echo`			`$JBOSS_HOME` to see if it is currently defined in your environment:

----
~]$ echo $JBOSS_HOME
----

The [app]` Platform` and most &THIS.PLATFORM; servers are built on top of the [app]`` ([app]``). When the [app]` Platform` or &THIS.PLATFORM; servers are built _from source_, then [var]`JBOSS_HOME` _must_ be set, because the &THIS.PLATFORM; files are installed into (or "`over top of`" if you prefer) a clean [app]`` installation, and the build process assumes that the location pointed to by the [var]`JBOSS_HOME` environment variable at the time of building is the [app]`` installation into which you want it to install the &THIS.PLATFORM; files. 

This guide does not detail building the [app]` Platform` or any &THIS.PLATFORM; servers from source.
It is nevertheless useful to understand the role played by [app]`JBoss AS` and [var]`JBOSS_HOME` in the &THIS.PLATFORM; ecosystem.

The immediately-following section considers whether you need to set [var]`JBOSS_HOME` at all and, if so, when.
The subsequent sections detail how to set [var]`JBOSS_HOME` on Unix and Windows 

IMPORTANT: Even if you fall into the category below of _not needing_ to set [var]`JBOSS_HOME`, you may want to for various reasons anyway.
Also, even if you are instructed that you do _not need_ to set [var]`JBOSS_HOME`, it is good practice nonetheless to check and make sure that [var]`JBOSS_HOME` actually _isn't_ set or defined on your system for some reason.
This can save you both time and frustration. 

You _DO NOT NEED_ to set [var]`JBOSS_HOME` if...

* ...you have installed the [app]` Platform` binary distribution. 
* ...you have installed a &THIS.PLATFORM;server binary distribution _which bundles [app]``._			

You _MUST_ set [var]`JBOSS_HOME` if...

* ...you are installing the [app]` Platform` or any of the &THIS.PLATFORM; servers _from source_. 
* ...you are installing the [app]` Platform` binary distribution, or one of the &THIS.PLATFORM; server binary distributions, which _do not_ bundle [app]``. 

Naturally, if you installed the [app]` Platform` or one of the &THIS.PLATFORM; server binary releases which _do not_ bundle [app]``, yet requires it to run, then you should install before setting [var]`JBOSS_HOME` or proceeding with anything else. 

.Setting the JBOSS_HOME Environment Variable on Unix
The [var]`JBOSS_HOME` environment variable must point to the directory which contains all of the files for the [app]` Platform` or individual &THIS.PLATFORM; server that you installed.
As another hint, this topmost directory contains a [path]_bin_ subdirectory. 

Setting [var]`JBOSS_HOME` in your personal [path]_~/.bashrc_ startup script carries the advantage of retaining effect over reboots.
Each time you log in, the environment variable is sure to be set for you, as a user.
On Unix, it is possible to set [var]`JBOSS_HOME` as a system-wide environment variable, by defining it in [path]_/etc/bashrc_, but this method is neither recommended nor detailed in these instructions. 

.Procedure: To Set JBOSS_HOME on Unix...
. Open the [path]_~/.bashrc_ startup script, which is a hidden file in your home directory, in a text editor, and insert the following line on its own line while substituting for the actual install location on your system: 
+
----
export JBOSS_HOME="/home/<username>/<path>/<to>/<install_directory>"
----

. Save and close the [path]_.bashrc_ startup script. 
. You should `source` the [path]_.bashrc_ script to force your change to take effect, so that [var]`JBOSS_HOME` becomes set for the current sessionfootnote:[Note that any other terminals which were opened prior to your having altered .bashrc will need to source
  ~/.bashrc as well should they require access to JBOSS_HOME.]. 
+
----
~]$ source ~/.bashrc
----

. Finally, ensure that [var]`JBOSS_HOME` is set in the current session, and actually points to the correct location: 
+
NOTE: The command line usage below is based upon a binary installation of the [app]` Platform`.
In this sample output, [var]`JBOSS_HOME` has been set correctly to the [replaceable]`topmost_directory` of the [app]`` installation.
Note that if you are installing one of the standalone [app]`` servers (with [app]`JBoss AS` bundled!), then [var]`JBOSS_HOME` would point to the [replaceable]`topmost_directory` of your server installation. 
+
----
~]$ echo $JBOSS_HOME
/home/silas/<path>/<to>/<install_directory>
----


.Setting the JBOSS_HOME Environment Variable on Windows
The [var]`JBOSS_HOME` environment variable must point to the directory which contains all of the files for the &THIS.PLATFORM;Platform or individual &THIS.PLATFORM;server that you installed.
As another hint, this topmost directory contains a [path]_bin_ subdirectory.
