== Manual Configuration

The RestComm Media Server features an extensible configuration file, allowing users to have some control over several aspects of its behavior.

Users can configure the Media Server by editing the file located at _$MS_HOME/conf/media-server.yml_. The YAML file is divided into several main nodes, each one representing a specific aspect of the Media Server:

* *Network* refers to the network configuration. Depends on network topology of the machine where Media Server is installed.
* *Media* refers to the media processing and RTP configuration.
* *Controller* refers to the Media Server Controller configuration. Defines which control protocol is used so that Media Server can communicate with Call Agents.
* *Resources* refers to the resource pooling configuration. Depends on expected load on the server.
* *DTLS* refers to configuration of security layer for media.

=== Network Configuration

.Network configuration
====
[source,yml]
----
mediaserver:
    network:
        bindAdress: 127.0.0.1
        externalAddress: 127.0.0.1
        network: 127.0.0.1
        subnet: 255.255.255.255
        sbc: false
----
====

==== Address Bindings

*BindAddress* is the address of the network interface to which Media Server is bound to. All RTP channels are open on this address.

*ExternalAddress* is the public address of the server. It is mainly used to patch SDP and to expose SRFLX candidates during ICE negotiation.

==== Network, Subnet and SBC

The Media server can work in two distinct modes: Standard or SBC.

When *sbc* is set to false, the Media Server will establish a channel based on address/port pair it receives from SDP response.
However, if the RTP packet is used within a NAT context, data sent in SDP is the original data and not the NATted IP address/port (this is often the scenario).
Furthermore, when *sbc* is set to false, data will be sent to invalid address and also will not be accepted since Media Server does not know the correct address of the UA.
 
In order to solve NAT issues the *sbc* option must be set to true.
As result, Media Server will wait for first RTP packet; learn its remote IP address and port and only then it will send data based on the remote address and not on SDP response.

As consequence inter-server traffic will not work since both sides will be waiting for first packet.
To solve this, you should set local network and local subnet to a range that will include all Media Servers in the same cluster.
If the Media Server detects that the IP address and port in SDP are within the local IP network range, it will start sending packets immediately and not wait.
This is similar to when *sbc* is set to false.


=== Controller Configuration

This configuration subset defines the default Media Server Controller, the core component that processes incoming requests and manages media resources.


The default controller is based on MGCP protocol. Enabling MGCP is always required as the JSR-309 driver is based on the current MGCP implementation as well.


.Controller Configuration
====
[source,yml]
----
  controller:
    mgcp:
      address: 127.0.0.1
      port: 2427
      channelBuffer: 5000
      endpoints:
        - name: "restcomm/bridge/"
          relay: splitter
        - name: "restcomm/ivr/"
          relay: mixer
        - name: "restcomm/cnf/"
          relay: mixer
----
====

==== Network

The *Address* parameter defines the address of the network interface to which the controller is bound to. The control channel is open on this address.

The *Port* parameter defines the port where the control channel will listen to for incoming requests. By default, it is set to 2427.

The *channelBuffer* parameter defines the MGCP channel buffer size which limits the size of incoming MGCP messages that are received by the MGCP channel. By default it is set to 5000.

==== Endpoints

The *Endpoints* configuration allows you to configure all MGCP endpoint groups you want to use with the Media Server instance.

The *Name* parameter represents the name pattern to be used for MGCP requests that target a specific endpoint type.
For example, the name pattern _mobicents/aap_ will be created and accessed as _mobicents/aap/$_ (where $ is an integer representing the endpoint ID).  

The *Relay* parameter defines how media should be processed by the endpoint: Mixed or Split.

Currently, the following endpoint classes are available :

.Endpoint Classes
[cols="1,1,1,1", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| Endpoint | Available Resources | Connection Types | Relay Type
| Ivr | Player, Recorder, Dtmf Detector, Dtmf Generator | Local+RTP | Mixer
| Conference | None | Local+RTP | Mixer
| Bridge | None | Local+RTP | Splitter
|===

A Mixer endpoint will mix together data from both connections and resources.
This implies that it will still be available even without the appropriate setting mode. 

A Splitter endpoint is not a standard MGCP endpoint type, as it handles two different resources groups.
The first group uses local connections whereas the second group uses RTP connections.
This implies that non-RTP connections can communicate with RTP endpoints and none local connections can still access local endpoints.

The Bridge endpoint, a Splitter type, is useful in the scenarios shown below: 

image::images/bridge-endpoint-ivr-conference.png[]

In this scenario, both IVR and Conference endpoints will be connected by a pair of Local Connections to the Bridge Endpoint. This is considered a good practice as there will be no cross over of IVR Resources (player , recorder , etc) to conference.
The same applies to any conference traffic, it will not cross over to IVR.
This is useful for recording RTP data for specific groups of users. 

=== Media Configuration

The media configuration contains definitions that have an impact on the media channels.

.Media Configuration
====
[source,yml]
----
  media:
    timeout: 0
    halfOpenDuration: 300
    maxDuration: 14400
    lowPort: 34534
    highPort: 65534
    jitterBuffer:
      size: 50
    codecs: pcmu,pcma,opus,l16,gsm,g729,telephone-event
----
====

==== RTP Channels

The *LowPort* and *HighPort* define the port range reserved for RTP channels.
These values should be an even number, since odd ports are reserved for RTCP channels.

The *HalfOpenDuration* value define the maximum duration an RTP channel can remain half-open, that is, in a state were is waiting for a response from the remote peer in order to fully establish the connection. If set to zero, the connection will stay half-open indeterminately.

The *MaxDuration* value defines the maximum duration an RTP channel can remain open, thus limiting the lifetime of calls. If set to zero, the connection will stay open forever.

The *JitterBuffer* size parameter sets the maximum capacity of the jitter buffer, in milliseconds.
Jitter Buffers are commonly configured to hold up to 50-60ms of audio.

==== RTP Timeout

Most SIP UA do not support any type of keep-alive between 200 OK and BYE.
Therefore, in case the network goes down while a call is established, the call may hang forever.
That is why RTP streaming should not be interrupted (exception to rule being _recvonly_ and _inactive_ modes). With the this in mind, the Media Server features the *timeout* parameter. 

When *timeout* is set to greater than 0, the Media Server will monitor RTP traffic and if it finds period equal or greater then the RTP timeout (in seconds) it will delete the connection and notify the server that a connection was removed (by sending DLCX MGCP command). Consequently, any border server will receive a reliable notification that the call is still alive even when the communication network is no longer available. 

NOTE: When enabling RTP timeout, it is recommended that you do not set the mode to _inactive_ or _sendonly_ when you expect to receive data (after 180 or 200 OK) depending on your application 

.Call Flow
====
[source,xml]
----

Similar call flow may be like this

UA ----> INVITE ----> Control Server
Control Server ----> CRCX with mode inactive ----> Media Server
Control Server ----> INVITE ----> inside network or to other side
Inside network or other side ----> 183 with SDP ----> Control Server
Control Server ---> MDCX with mode sendonly ---> Media Server
Control Server ---> 183 with SDP ----> UA
Inside network or other side ----> 200 ----> Control Server
Control Server ---> MDCX with mode sendrecv ---> Media Server
Control Server ---> 200 ----> UA
----
====

In case of 180 or 183 without SDP response , intermediate MDCX is not required. 


==== Codecs

Currently media server supports six codecs : G711 A/U, Linear PCM Raw, GSM, ILBC, OPUS and G.729.

If you decide to use a single codec for encoding or decoding data, you should leave one RAW or 2 Raw pair.
This is useful only in case of a one way activity. 

.L16 usage
NOTE: L16 codec is useful only in server to server communication where you have enough network bandwidth.
It is not recommended to allow L16 codec for UA â€“ server connections, this can lead to degradation of the signal quality due to increased jitter and packet loss.

.OPUS usage
NOTE: Opus codec processes data internally at 8kHz as mono signal. This sample rate and number of channels are limiting factors for sound quality when this codec is used. Bitrate is around 20 kbps.

==== OPUS Codec Configuration

http://opus-codec.org/[Opus Codec] is open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec.

Pre-requisite library for Opus codec is `libopus` (or `libopus-dev` if the project is compiled from sources).

[source,shell]
----
# CentOS/RHEL
yum install libopus

# Ubuntu/Debian
apt-get install libopus

# macOS
brew install opus
----

The location of libopus library and name of compiled JNI library used by media server are specified by command line parameters. The values of the parameters are defined in file `bin/run.sh`.


=== Resources Configuration

In the current Media Server release, a global pool of resources is used to decrease garbage collection and allow for faster resource allocation.

.Resources Configuration
====
[source,yml]
----
  resources:
    player:
      connectionTimeout: 2000
      cache:
        enabled: false
        size: 100
    dtmfDetector:
      dbi: -35
      toneDuration: 100
      toneInterval: 20
    dtmfGenerator:
      toneVolume: -20
      toneDuration: 100
----
====

The Media Server features the following media resources:

* *Player* - Plays audio tracks;
* *Recorder* - Records audio streams;
* *Voice Activity Detector* - Detects speech in media stream;
* *DTMF Generator* - Generates out-of-band DTMF tones;
* *DTMF Detector* - Detects both inband and out-of-band tones;

.About DTMF Detector Dbi
[NOTE]
====
Audio data is mixed with DTMF inband tones often.
As result, Media Server may detect false positive tones, or it may not detect tones which are sent.

By setting DTMF detector dbi parameter, the user can optimize tone detection by fine-tuning this parameter. However, default value has been tested and found to be generally appropriate.

Good practice mandates that inband tones should be used only in SS7/IP mixed network.
IP-only networks should use out-of-band tones only and disable inband detection. 
====

=== DTLS Configuration

The DTLS configuration allows to define some properties that are used by WebRTC resources, through the DTLS protocol. Since the nature of this configuration is strongly related with security principles, *some of the default values of this configuration need to be replaced by the user's private information, ensuring that no vulnerabilities could be exploited by someone else.* This refers mainly to the *certificate*, that is shipped with mediaserver for demonstration purposes only, and its better explained in the *Certificate* subsection.

----
====

==== DTLS Version

The properties *minVersion* and *maxVersion* define the supported minimum and maximum version of the DTLS protocol, respectively. The possible values suported by each property is *1.0* or *1.2*. 

==== Cipher suites

The *cipherSuites* property allows to inform one or more cipher suites to be used by DTLS. The names of the suites follows the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#ciphersuites[JSSE cipher suite naming standard] and must be separated by comma.
The following examples show how to set the cipher suites can be configured using *RSA* and *ECDSA*.

==== Certificate

This property allows to set the absolute or relative path of the certificate and key files. The path for the certificate file must be informed in the *path* property, and the path for the key file must be informed in the *key* property. The signature algorithm used for the certificates must be informed at the *algorithm* property, which supports the values *rsa* and *ecdsa*. The default certificate files must be replaced by certificates generated by the user, as described by the following warning:

IMPORTANT: The default certificate files that comes with mediaserver are for test purposes only. The use of the default certificates in production environment represent a potential vulnerability. *The default certificate files must be replaced by certificates generated by the user.*

The certificate files *x509-server.pem* and *x509-server-key.pem* correspond to the default *RSA* certificates, while the files *x509-server-ecdsa.pem* and *x509-server-key-ecdsa.pem* correspond to the default *ECDSA* certificates. Those files can be found at the directory *$MS_HOME/conf/dtls* of a mediaserver installation.
The following examples show how to properly set up mediaserver according to the chosen signature algorithm (*RSA* or *ECDSA*). Note that the *cipher suites*, *certificates* and *algorithm* change from one configuration to another.

=== Configure Speech Recognition Drivers

Media Server supports Automatic Speech Recognition functionality albeit depending on third party service providers such as Google Speech or IBM Watson.

It features a *pluggable* architecture, allowing users to choose their favourite provider. To do so, the user only needs to provide and register a driver in the configuration file.
To install a new driver users simply need to copy the driverâ€™s jar file to the `MS_HOME/lib` directory and declare it in the configuration file.

The `media-server.yml` configuration file contains a specific section to define list of supported drivers grouped by subsystem:

.Configuration for drivers subsystem
====
[source,yml]
----
  drivers:
    driver-type:
      driver-name:
        type: org.restcomm.media.driver.SomeDriver
        parameters:
          param1: 1
          param2: true
          param3: "value"
----
====

Each driver must declare the attributes `name` and `class`. Furthermore, each driver can require a custom list of parameters. Each parameter is composed by a pair of `name` and `value` attributes.
Example:

.Example configuration for drivers subsystem
====
[source,yml]
----
  drivers:
    asr:
      watson:
        type: org.restcomm.media.driver.asr.MyWatsonDriver
        parameters:
          hertz: 8000
          responseTimeout: 1000
          interimResults: true
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Sometimes a driver will require system-wide configuration, such as environment variables to be defined.

Itâ€™s responsibility of the user to consult with ASR Service Provider about configuration requirements for a given driver.
====

=== Configuring Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

**SSL** is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browsers remain private and integral.

.Configuration for SSL
====
[source,yml]
----
  ssl:
    keyStore: mykey.jks
    keyStorePassword: mypass
    trustStore: mytrust.jks
    trustStorePassword: mypass
    trustStoreType: jks
    debug: false
----
====

If user wishes to enable SSL, then he must assign the path of the KeyStore and/or TrustSotre as well as its password(s).

[NOTE]
====
User can set KeyStore and TrustStor to relative or absolute URL. If relative URL is used, then the root address of the URL will be the root directory of the Media Server installation (commonly known as _MS_HOME_).
====

[[_ctms_configuring_the_media_server_override]]
== Overriding Default Configuration

To make life easier for users, the RestComm Media Server offers a simple mechanism for overriding the default configuration parameters.

By editing the `MS_HOME/conf/media-extra.yml` file users can override the configuration parameters they need without having to go through every aspect of the Media Server configuration.

The following example shows how users can override configuration of the Network by enabling SBC mode and how to enable caching for the Audio Player resource.
