# RestComm Media Server, Community Edition

**RestComm Media Server, Community Edition** (RMS) is a standalone real-time Media Server developed in Java.

It offers a set of rich media features, such as streaming, conferencing, recording, playback, IVR, text-to-speech, etc.
It also supports and is compliant with [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/).

The Media Server can be accessed programmatically, using either MGCP or JSR 309 drivers.
Both drivers run in Java EE, SIP Servlets or JSLEE containers.

Thanks to its pluggable architecture, the Media Server binary is basically an assembly of the [media-core framework](https://github.com/RestComm/media-core) plus a set of plugins that define the behaviour of specific features, such as ASR, VAD, Codecs, etc.
Users can enable or disable plugins in the Media Server configuration, thus easily adapting the behaviour of the Media Server to their requirements.
